I've always been a builder. Whether it was designing extensive UI kits as *ElitePSD* or architecting healthcare platforms at *HTWorks*, my focus has always been on the output. But recently, I've realized that the process is just as valuable as the result.

## The "Silent" Engineer

It's easy to get lost in the code. You solve a complex problem, push the commit, and move on to the next ticket. But that knowledge—the "aha" moments, the debugging nightmares, the architectural decisions—often stays trapped in our heads or buried in a Slack thread.

I want to change that.

### What to Expect

This blog won't just be tutorials (though there will be some). I plan to write about:
*   **The intersection of Design & Engineering**: How to bridge the gap.
*   **Startup Life**: Lessons from being a Founding Engineer.
*   **Deep Dives**: Technical explorations into things I'm learning (like Astro, AI agents, etc.)

Here's to new beginnings. 🚀
